# Python - Slicing Strings
# get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included):
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])

# Slice From the Start
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[:5])

# Slice To the End
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:])

# Negative Indexing
# From: "o" in "World!" (position -5)
# To, but not included: "d" in "World!" (position -2):
b = "Hello, World!" 
print(b[-5:-2])
